# 🎬 Movie Analytics — End-to-End Data Science & Machine Learning Project

An applied **data science project** exploring real-world movie industry datasets using supervised machine learning models.  
This project includes the **full workflow**: dataset integration, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and performance evaluation.

Models implemented include:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

All models were compared using validation metrics and iteratively improved to enhance prediction accuracy.
